* Set context to @VAPT-Secure

* Prepare a plan to review the Computation of the "Copy AI Design Prompt" instructions for the `Interface Schema JSON`, which must satisfy the requirements as laid downn in the latest `VAPT-Secure\data\VAPT_AI_Agent_System_README_v*.md` and the supporting files, in continuation with the `Development Instructions (AI Guidance)` instructions created earlier.

* The objective should always remain to create clear, un-ambigous and concise instruction for the AI Agent enabling it deliver `Inrerface Schema JSON`, which helps transform it into a Production ready Visual Design and a very competitive "Automated Verification Engine" protocol.

* All the Target URL's need to be fully Qualified. Special attention needs to be paid to the generation of the Target URL's [they must be relevant to the test, fully Qualified and should be there as a Link].

* The most important aspect which must not be compromised is that it should be ensured in any case to that the provided code snippet actually gets to its desired target, like if it was meant to add some directives to the .htaccess file - they must get added to the .htaccess file. 

* it should be consistent for other `Driver's` as well - the support should be there for the Platforms like Apache, Nginx, fail2ban, PHP Functions [should be added to the Active themes functions.php], IIS, Cloudflare, Caddy, Litespeed.

* The choice for the Enforcer Driver should be clear and should ensure that the suggested Protection is actually being applied to the domain.

* The AI Design Prompt should respect the State of the toggles like "Include Manual Verification Protocol" and "Include Operational Notes Section" and the Generated "Interface Schema JSON" should have them included, if Enabled.

* The target is to get AI Output Quality Accuracy score of above 95%-100%.
